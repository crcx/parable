# Flags

A flag is a boolean value. They are typically returned by comparison functions or by the **true** and **false** functions.

Flags have three states:

* true
* false
* invalid

A **true** flag corresponds to a numeric value of -1. A **false** flag corresponds to a value of 0. Any other value is considered invalid.
