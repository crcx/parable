<h1>Strings</h1>

<p>A string is a slice containing a sequence of characters. They are denoted using a single quote at the beginning and end.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>'hello, world'
'this is a string'
'yet another, much longer string containing a bunch of data'
</code></pre>

<p>Each string is stored in a separate slice. Strings are zero terminated.</p>

<p><em>Tip: don't use double quotes (") for strings. Double quotes are used for comments.</em></p>
