<h1>Comments</h1>

<p>A comment is a string which is ignored by the language. They start and end with a quotation mark.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>[ "this is a comment" #33 ] '33' define
</code></pre>

<p>Comments get compiled into the functions, but are ignored at runtime. (This is wasteful of space,
but makes it possible to decompile back to a form much closer to the original source).</p>
