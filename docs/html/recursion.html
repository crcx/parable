<h1>Recursion</h1>

<p>In Parable, recursion is handled through redefintion. So a simple recursive loop might look like:</p>

<pre><code>[ ] 'foo' define
[ foo ] 'foo' define
</code></pre>

<p>An unending loop isn't much use, but we can implement a simple counted loop using recursion by doing:</p>

<pre><code>[ ] 'foo' define
[ dup #10 &lt;&gt; [ dup #1 + foo ] if-true ] 'foo' define

#1 foo
</code></pre>

<p>Recursion is a powerful tool, but it's often more practical to use the looping combinators instead. E.g., the above counted loop could also be done without recursion using the <strong>repeat</strong> combinator.</p>

<pre><code>#1 #10 [ dup #1 + ] repeat
</code></pre>
