<h1>Variables &amp; Values</h1>

<p>Parable provides support for simple variables through two approaches (variables, and values).</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>A variable in Parable is simply a pointer to a slice. The value stored in the first location of the slice can be accessed via <strong>@</strong> and updated using <strong>!</strong>.</p>

<p>For a simple example, consider:</p>

<pre><code>'temp' variable

"store 100 into the temp variable"
#100 &amp;temp !

"read the value stored in the variable named temp:"
&amp;temp @

"Multiply the value in temp by 1000 and update it with the new value:"
&amp;temp @ #1000 * &amp;temp !
</code></pre>

<p>Variables are quick and easy, but when you need to use them a lot, it can make the code messy and harder to follow. It's best to avoid them whenever possible.</p>

<h2>Values</h2>

<p>A value is similar to a variable in that it holds a single value. But they're a bit more flexible in that they are actually functions, not raw pointers. They are created using <strong>value</strong> and updated using <strong>to</strong>.</p>

<p>Consider the following, which is functionally equivilent to the example for <em>variable</em>:</p>

<pre><code>'temp' value

"store 100 into the temp variable"
#100 to temp

"read the value stored in the variable named temp:"
temp

"Multiply the value in temp by 1000 and update it with the new value:"
temp #1000 * to temp
</code></pre>

<p>Values are cleaner to read than values, but have additional overhead since they need to decide whether they are being read or updated.</p>

<p>Unlike variables, values store and restore the data type automatically. E.g., to store and work on a string you could do:</p>

<pre><code>'temp' variable
'hello' &amp;temp !
&amp;temp @ :p :s 'world!' +
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>'temp' value
'hello' to temp
temp 'world!' +
</code></pre>
