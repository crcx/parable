# Strings

A string is a slice containing a sequence of characters. They are denoted using a single quote at the beginning and end.

Examples:

    'hello, world'
    'this is a string'
    'yet another, much longer string containing a bunch of data'

Each string is stored in a separate slice. Strings are zero terminated.

*Tip: don't use double quotes (") for strings. Double quotes are used for comments.*
