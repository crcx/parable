# Strings

A string is a slice containing a sequence of characters. They are denoted using a single quote at the beginning and end.

Examples:

    'hello, world'
    'this is a string'
    'yet another, much longer string containing a bunch of data'

Each string is stored in a separate slice. String length is the same as the corresponding slice length.

*Tip: make sure to use use single quotes (') for strings. Double quotes are used for comments.*
